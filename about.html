        1. Occasional self medication has always been part of normal living. The making and selling of
        drugs has a long history and is closely linked, like medical practice itself, with belief in magic.
        Only during the last hundred years or so has the development of scientific techniques made
        diagnosis possible. The doctor is now able to follow up the correct diagnosis of many
        illnesses-with specific treatment of their cause. In many other illnesses of which the causes
        remain unknown, he is still limited, like the unqualified prescriber, to the treatment of
        symptoms. The doctor is trained to decide when to treat symptoms only and when to attack
        the cause. This is the essential difference between medical prescribing and self-medication.

        2. The advance of technology has brought about much progress in some fields of medicine,
        including the development of scientific drug therapy. In many countries public health
        organisation is improving and peoples’ nutritional standards have risen. Parallel with such
        beneficial trends are two which have an adverse effect. One is the use of high pressure
        advertising by the pharmaceutical industry which has tended to influence both patients and
        doctors and has lead to the overuse of drugs generally. The other is the emergence of
        sedentary society with its faulty ways of living: lack of exercise, overeating, unsuitable
        eating, insufficient sleep, excessive smoking and drinking. People with disorders arising from
        faulty habits such as these, as well as from unhappy human relationships, often resort to
        self-medication. Advertisers go to great lengths to catch this market.
        3. Clever advertising aimed at chronic sufferers; who will try anything because doctors have
        not been able to cure them; can induce faith in a medicine, particularly if it is steeply priced.
        Advertisements are also aimed at people suffering from mild complaints such as simple
        colds and coughs which advertisements claim will clear up within a short time due to the
        intake of a medicinal product.
        4. These are the main reasons why laxatives, indigestion-remedies, pain killers, cough –
        mixtures, tonics, vitamins and iron tablets, nose drops, ointments and many other
        preparations are found in quantity in many households. It is doubtful whether taking these
        things even improves a person’s health or it simply makes it worse. Worse, because the
        preparation may contain unsuitable ingredients making a person dependent on them. They
        may also cause poisoning and worst of all the symptoms of an underlying problem may be
        masked and therefore medical help may be sought. Self-diagnosis is a greater danger than
        self-medication.
